# Arcana Product Manifesto

## Vision
Arcana is not just an app; it is the digital hearth of our home. It connects Sylvia, Aliou, Sacha, and Lisa through shared organization and "Aha!" moments.

## Core Values

### 1. Apple-like Simplicity
If it needs a manual, it's broken. Interfaces should be clean, whitespace-heavy, and intuitive.

### 2. Vibe Engineering
Software should feel alive.
- Loaders are boring; skeletons are better.
- Success states should look like a celebration (Confetti, bounces).
- Transitions should be fluid (framer-motion).

### 3. Intelligence, not Gimmicks
AI (Gemini) is used to save time (scanning books) or create value (summaries), not to generate noise.

### 4. Family First (Kids Mode)
The system adapts to the user. Sacha (9) and Lisa (6) see a different version of reality than the parents.

### 5. Zero-Debt
We build it right the first time. Strong typing, strict linting, clean architecture.
